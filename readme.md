# My Bash Configuration

## Installation

1) Clone this repo locally

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/wfa207/bash-config ~/.bash-config
```

2) Run the installation script

```bash
$ cd ~/.bash-config
$ . install.sh
```

## Configuration

There are a few additional things that have to be tweaked after you complete the installation:
- Set your font to a Powerline-enabled font (I usually use Inconsolata)

## Plugins

Currently, the only plugin used is bash-powerline
